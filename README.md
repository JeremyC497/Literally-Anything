## Statement of Problem

Return the solution(s?) of the maze from the designated start point to the designated end point

## Recursive Abstraction

When I am asked to choose between n paths where n > 1(and assumed n < 4), the recursive abstraction can provide a
choice of n â€“ 1 paths to choose between.

## Base Case

When the end point has been reached.

## English or pseudocode description of algorithm

If the base case is true, then it should stop and return the solution.
Else, the method will proceed based on the number of paths available.
If there is one path, it will proceed down that path.
If there is more than one path, it will invoke the recursive abstraction.
